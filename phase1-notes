- processes & connections
basically the same table
- devices
Store name is very high cardinality, not good for ML
Code should be named country code
Code has many outliers. 72% of the data is top 19 most used codes, rest is the remaining 112 codes. Probably make it
From location we split into continent/city
We can use classification to change latitude and longitude in profiles to continents.
- devices has duplicate data
- location
table devices contains columns for latitude and longitude, column profiles contains it as a tuple of decimals in one column (Decimal('-27.447495'), Decimal('-43.231283'))

for 1.2b:
null values are only in profiles: job, current_location, residence, address
for 1.3:
hypothesis 1: profiles.mail has effect on mwra

1.2B = 1.2A missing values
1.2C = 1.2A deviated values
